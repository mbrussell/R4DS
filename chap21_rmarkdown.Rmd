Change to global options in a code chunk for the rest of the document:

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = F
)
```


The difference between an R Notebook and R Markdown document is [explained well here](http://uc-r.github.io/r_notebook). With an R Notebook, you can visually assess the output as you develop your R Markdown document without having to knit the entire document to see the output. Mostly everything else appears the same.

Think about naming code chunks, like below:

```{r myChunk}
# I named the RMarkdown chunk.
```

```{r}
mtcars[1:5, 1:8]

knitr::kable(
  mtcars[1:5,],
  caption = "A knitr table."
)
```

The mean of the mpg in the mtcars data set is `r round(mean(mtcars$mpg), 1)` miles per gallon.

You can add an EndNote bibliography to the an R Markdown document.
