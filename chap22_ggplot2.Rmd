# ggplot tips and tricks  
* You can change the legend title in `labs()` by specifying `color = "My new legend title."`
* You can add statistical notation in axes/titles
* `scale_x_log10` and `scale_y_log10` allow you to plot values in their log-transformed units
* Figure sizes can be set within R Markdown code chunks, e.g., `fig.width = 6` and `fig.asp = 0.618` (the golden ratio).
